We believe in
==============
Lean, reliable pieces of software that enables us (you) to do better web applications.

If we are able to measure, then we are able to compare. If we can compare, then we can improve.

Overview
----------
waskr can catch metrics that are key to measure your application's performance:

*  Requests per Second
*  Request Time (to respond)

If you are able to tell how many requests per second you are dealing with and how much each request is taking to respond you can be in better control of your application's needs.

Background
------------
The name waskr comes from the Inca Emperor Waskar who ruled the Inca Empire from 1527 to 1532 AD. Just about the time when they 
were building Machu Picchu.
